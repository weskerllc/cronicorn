Next is ADR's (architectural decision review)

I like to have a .adr folder that sits in the root of my repo.

And I require that any important decision that is made - there MUST be a new markdown file with a concise but compl,ete overview of the decision. These are wildly important because I tell the ai agents to reference these docs when needed - and also I can see the important decisions in order. (the files are named with a numerical ordered prefix)

To answer the question of 'when' to create an ADR (i.e. what level of importance does a decision have to be to justify having an adr - I'll just say I recomend having more than less.)
