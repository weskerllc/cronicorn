Well. This is my first blog post.

I’ve avoided writing one for years because I never felt like an “expert” at anything. There’s always someone smarter. Someone deeper. Someone who already wrote the post — and did it better, with more graphs and better citations.

That’s still true. I’m not an AI expert. I’m not the cleanest developer either.

I am a senior software engineer with 8+ years of experience. Enough scars to know when something’s going sideways. Not enough ego to pretend I’ve got it all figured out.

While I’m writing this, I keep asking myself why.
Attention? Not really. A couple extra GitHub followers might feel nice for five minutes.
Validation? Also no.

So why bother?

Because AI has been my main side obsession as a developer for the last two or three years. I’ve had a front-row seat to the full glow-up — especially for code generation. I’ve spent hundreds — probably thousands — of hours building with AI. Not demos. Things with consequences.

Early on, it was just copy-pasting into the original ChatGPT UI. No agents. No tools. Just a chat box. It was clumsy and inefficient — and still the biggest shift in my workflow in my entire career. Twenty-five Stack Overflow tabs turned into one conversation. Personalized feedback. Real-time debugging. Actual momentum.

When I first ran into LangChain, I didn’t know it at the time, but that was the turning point. Had to watch “AI function calling for dummies” videos just to understand why it mattered.

Since then, I’ve bounced between Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Claude Code. I’ve played with more autonomous setups too — OpenHands, AutoMaker, the whole “let the agent run” idea.

And here’s the part nobody advertises:

In most of those projects — especially early on — I drove the whole thing straight into a wall.

Over-prompted. Over-generated. Lost the plot. Ended up with bloated, fragile garbage I didn’t understand anymore. Hours gone. Sometimes days. That awful moment where the project feels irreversible and starting over feels easier than fixing it.

That feeling sucks. Deeply. You don’t just lose time — you lose trust in yourself. And yeah, I’ve sat there wondering what value those hours actually added to my life. I could’ve been outside. Reading. Doing literally anything else.

I tell myself a comforting lie sometimes: maybe this all makes me more “AI-proof.” Maybe these hours are an investment. Maybe.

What is true is this: after enough wrecked projects, I started forming rules. Hard rules. Those rules weren’t Googled. They weren’t generated. They were earned the dumb way — by doing it wrong over and over.

That’s why I’m writing this.

If this saves even a few people from burning weeks the way I did, that feels worth it. If it helps someone stay in control instead of drowning in output, even better.

Alright. Enough throat-clearing.

Let’s get into it.
