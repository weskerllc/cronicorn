Well - here's my first blog post ever. 

To be honest I've never felt like I was an 'expert' enough on anything to write a blog post.

Or - there would always be somebody who was more of an expert - or more importantly - already wrote an article on the same topic - and they were better AND more well researched on the topic than me.

And you know what.... that is still the case here. I am not an AI expert. Nor the cleanest developer.

(Somehow humble flex that I AM a Senior developer with 8+ years experience to give some sort of credibility to this at all)

And also even as I'm writing this I'm wondering - why am I? Do I want attention? Not really - maybe a couple extra github followers would make me happy for a few minutes and fade away. Do I want validation? No not really either.

So what is the goal of doing this? 

To be honest - AI has been my number 1 'side interest' as a software developer for the last 2 to 3 years. I am lucky enough to have seen the FULL glow-up of AI - especially when it comes to generating code.

I have spent hundreds if not THOUSANDS of hours sitting and writing code with AI. 

I'll start with my best recollection of how I personally saw AI coding progress over these years - before getting into the actual point of this article.

Initially it was copy / pasting into the early chatgpt ui. LONG before coding agents or even agents / tool calling in general. This was very inneficient - but it was a positive affect on my workflow - and also the biggest change in my development workflow of my entire career. Going from having 25 stackoverflow tabs open every day to having a chat window open. Getting personalized and decent advice on my code. Features / bugs / you name it.

Then I remember seeing LangChain for the first time. I had to watch some videos on AI function calling for dummies (now talked about as 'tool calling') just to wrap my head around the point. At the time I didnt realize that this was a huge breakthrough that everything would then be built off of.

My experience with AI dev tools has primarily been Cursor -> Github Copilot -> Claude Code. 

And for some additional layers of autonomy / task execution I have spent time in openhands, automaker(new). 

THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I WANT TO GET ACROSS: I have written so many projects (probably hundreds) / features (probably thousands) using AI - and in 90% of them - especially early on - I've stomped it into the ground too far and got to a point where it got messy, overwhelming - feeling like I wasnt in control - it was irriversible and I just wasted hours or days - too overwhelmed to even continue the project - better off just starting over. Just generating absolute shit. 

And honestly this is a horrible feeling. Wasting time, money. Unfortunately I have done this enough to where now I sit here and cringe about it. What *value* are those hours giving to my life. I could've been doing anything else. Outside tossing the frisbee, hanging out with friends, reading a book.

But then I try to make myself feel less sad by pretending: "Hey maybe this positions myself better when AI comes after developer jobs. Maybe these hours are hours making me better at harnassing ai and my employer will decide to keep me around"

Because after all - heartbreak , wasted time, money aside - I have created a set of rules that I use on projects where AI is one of my coworkers / minions / etc. This list of rules has been created over time. meticulously crafted by creating shit project after shit project. learning from mistakes. This is just to assure you that I am not just 'googling' 'top techniques for vibe coding' or ai generating this. These have been tested by a human FOR other humans.

And you know what - maybe this answers the question about why I'm writing this in the first place. Maybe enough of you will find value in this and waste less time - maybe you'll share it - and I'll feel less depressed at night laying staring at the ceiling.


Anyways - lets jump into the meat of this.
