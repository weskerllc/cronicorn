Next is going to be code quality in the case of linting. I like to be extra strict here. Regardless of what human / agents work on my project - I want to make sure it all is following the same very strict ruleset. not only on best practices (i.e. eslint typescript integration) - but also things like spacing etc.

For typescript projects, by far my favorite thing to use is eslint with antfu plugin.

Similar to tests - this must pass before the ai completes every task
