# Other tips
- maybe talk about the importance of your ai config ymls (i.e. claude.md)
  - Ensure your agent doesn't over-engineer. Often times I like to say something like: 'favor simplicity / readability over sexiness or overcomplexity. Stay on track and do not add any unwanted bells or whistles. do not re-invent the wheel, etc'
  - Always use something like Context7 or web search to get up to date docs when doing anything library related.
  - Comments are okay - just keep them concise. concise is my favorite word to use with ai. this could be its own section
