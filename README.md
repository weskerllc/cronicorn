## What Makes It Different?

Traditional cron jobs run on fixed schedules—and so do modern workflow platforms like n8n, Trigger.dev, and Temporal. Cronicorn's AI adapts to real-time conditions, automatically adjusting job frequency based on your system's actual behavior.

- 👁️ **Transparent Decisions** - See why every job ran—or didn't—with full history and AI reasoning trails
- 📊 **Driven by Your Data** - AI schedules jobs using the metrics your services return—no guesswork

## Use Cases

**Content Publishing** - Posts scheduled for 9am → high engagement → AI suggests immediate follow-up  
**Web Scraping** - Requests every 5sec → rate limit warning → slows to 30sec → recovers → resumes
