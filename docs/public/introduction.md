# Introduction to Cronicorn

[![GitHub Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/weskerllc/cronicorn?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/weskerllc/cronicorn/releases)
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@cronicorn%2Fmcp-server.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cronicorn/mcp-server)

**Cronicorn** is an intelligent scheduler that automatically adapts to your application's behavior. Set baseline schedules and let AI optimize execution timing based on real-world patterns.

---

## 🤖 Recommended: Use the MCP Server

**The easiest way to use Cronicorn is through your AI assistant.** Just chat to create jobs, monitor executions, and debug issues—no forms, no clicking.

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/@cronicorn%2Fmcp-server.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cronicorn/mcp-server)

```bash
npm install -g @cronicorn/mcp-server
```

Configure it with GitHub Copilot, Claude Desktop, or any MCP-compatible AI assistant. Then just talk:

- *"Set up a job that checks my API health every 5 minutes"*
- *"Show me why that endpoint is failing"*
- *"Migrate my 10 Vercel cron jobs to Cronicorn"*

## What is Cronicorn?

Cronicorn is a scheduling service that combines:

- **Traditional cron scheduling** - Set fixed intervals or cron expressions
- **AI-powered adaptation** (optional) - Automatically adjust timing based on success rates, failure patterns, and performance
- **HTTP endpoint execution** - Call any HTTP endpoint on your schedule
- **Real-time monitoring** - Track execution history, success rates, and performance

## Why Use Cronicorn?

### Problems with Static Schedulers

Traditional cron jobs have limitations:

- **Fixed timing** - Run every 5 minutes whether needed or not
- **No learning** - Repeated failures don't trigger automatic backoff
- **Manual intervention** - You adjust schedules manually based on metrics
- **Resource waste** - Over-polling wastes API rate limits and costs

### How Cronicorn Helps

**For all users:**
- Set it and forget it - Define baseline schedules that just work
- Real-time visibility - Track all executions with detailed history
- Flexible scheduling - Use cron expressions or simple intervals
- Constraint protection - Set min/max intervals to prevent over/under execution

**With AI enabled (optional):**
- Automatic adaptation - Schedules adjust based on actual performance
- Intelligent backoff - Reduces frequency after failures automatically
- Dynamic optimization - Increases frequency when needed, decreases when idle
- Always respects your constraints - AI suggestions stay within your min/max limits

## Key Features

### 🗓️ Flexible Scheduling

- **Cron expressions**: `"0 */5 * * *"` for traditional cron syntax
- **Simple intervals**: `300000` (milliseconds) for straightforward timing
- **One-time runs**: Schedule immediate or future single executions
- **Pause/resume**: Temporarily disable endpoints for maintenance

### 🤖 AI Adaptation (Optional)

When enabled, the AI planner:

- Analyzes execution patterns (success rates, failure streaks, response times)
- Suggests interval adjustments with expiration times (TTL)
- Respects your configured min/max constraints
- Gracefully degrades - baseline schedule continues if AI is unavailable

**Note**: Cronicorn works perfectly without AI. The baseline scheduler is production-ready and reliable.

### 📊 Complete Visibility

- **Run history**: Every execution with timestamps, duration, status
- **Error tracking**: Detailed error messages for failures
- **Success metrics**: Track success rates and identify patterns
- **Scheduling transparency**: See why each run happened (baseline, AI hint, etc.)

### 🛡️ Production Ready

- **Reliable execution**: Database-backed with distributed locking
- **Constraint protection**: Min/max intervals prevent runaway schedules
- **Multi-tenant isolation**: Secure separation between accounts
- **API & Web UI**: Manage jobs programmatically or visually

## Three Ways to Access Cronicorn

Every Cronicorn feature is available through **all three interfaces**. Choose based on your workflow:

| Interface | Best For | Example |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Web UI** | Visual management, dashboards, quick edits | Point-and-click job creation |
| **REST API** | Scripts, CI/CD, external integrations | `curl -X POST /api/jobs` |
| **MCP Server** | AI assistants (Copilot, Claude) | "Create a health check job" |

### Complete Example: Create Adaptive Health Check

**Web UI:**
1. Click "Create Job" → Name: "API Monitoring"
2. Click "Add Endpoint" → URL: `https://api.example.com/health`
3. Set baseline interval: 5 minutes
4. Set min interval: 30 seconds, max: 15 minutes
5. Add description: "Poll faster when errors detected, return to baseline when healthy"

**REST API:**
```bash
# Create job
curl -X POST https://api.cronicorn.com/api/jobs \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "API Monitoring"}'

# Add endpoint with adaptive config
curl -X POST https://api.cronicorn.com/api/jobs/JOB_ID/endpoints \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Health Check",
    "url": "https://api.example.com/health",
    "method": "GET",
    "baselineIntervalMs": 300000,
    "minIntervalMs": 30000,
    "maxIntervalMs": 900000,
    "description": "Poll faster when errors detected, return to baseline when healthy"
  }'
```

**MCP Server (via AI assistant):**
```
"Create a job called API Monitoring with a health check endpoint
at https://api.example.com/health. Run every 5 minutes normally,
but allow AI to speed up to 30 seconds during issues and slow
down to 15 minutes when healthy."
```

All three methods create identical configurations. The AI reads your description and response data to adapt scheduling within your constraints.

## How It Works

1. **Create a Job** - Logical container for related endpoints
2. **Add Endpoints** - HTTP endpoints with baseline schedules
3. **Set Constraints** (optional) - Min/max intervals for safety
4. **Enable AI** (optional) - Let AI optimize timing automatically
5. **Monitor** - Track execution history and performance

## Who Is Cronicorn For?

- **SaaS developers** monitoring API health across services
- **E-commerce teams** syncing inventory and order data
- **DevOps engineers** running scheduled maintenance tasks
- **Integration developers** managing webhook retries and polling
