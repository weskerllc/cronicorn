DEMO STRUCTURE (2:30 - 3:00 minutes)
================================================================================

ACT 1: THE PROBLEM (0:00 - 0:30)
   - Show static cron jobs failing during crisis
   - Developer manually adjusting at 2 AM
   - Introduce Cronicorn as the solution

ACT 2: THE SETUP (0:30 - 1:15)
   - Sign in with GitHub (quick)
   - Create job: "API Health Monitoring"
   - Add endpoint with URL, schedule, and constraints
   - Highlight safety constraints (min/max)

ACT 3: THE MAGIC (1:15 - 2:15) ⭐ HERO SECTION
   - Baseline: Regular 5-minute intervals (all green)
   - Crisis: 3 failures → AI tightens to 30 seconds
   - Recovery: Success → gradual backoff → baseline
   - Full day view: Complete adaptation cycle

ACT 4: THE CONTROL (2:15 - 2:45)
   - Show execution logs with full details
   - AI transparency panel with plain English
   - Highlight filters, search, debugging tools

ACT 5: THE CLOSE (2:45 - 3:00)
   - Comparison: Traditional cron vs Cronicorn
   - Clear CTA: Sign up at cronicorn.com
   - Secondary links: docs, GitHub, MCP server

================================================================================
KEY VALUE PROPOSITIONS
================================================================================

1. ZERO CODE CHANGES
   - No SDK to install or deploy
   - Just point at existing HTTP endpoints
   - 5-minute setup

2. AUTOMATIC ADAPTATION
   - AI learns from endpoint behavior
   - Tightens during failures
   - Relaxes during stability
   - No manual tuning required

3. SAFETY-FIRST DESIGN
   - Min/max constraints prevent runaway behavior
   - AI always respects boundaries
   - Graceful degradation (baseline continues if AI unavailable)

4. COMPLETE TRANSPARENCY
   - Every execution logged
   - Every AI decision explained in plain English
   - Full debugging context

5. DEVELOPER-FRIENDLY
   - Clean, intuitive UI
   - MCP integration for AI assistants
   - Self-hosting option available
   - Production-ready reliability

================================================================================
CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS
================================================================================

✓ Timeline visualization is the star - spend most time here
✓ Show real behavior, not mockups or animations
✓ Keep it under 3 minutes (viewers drop off after)
✓ Emphasize "automatic" and "no manual intervention"
✓ Make CTA crystal clear (cronicorn.com)
✓ Use time-lapse for wait times (4x speed)
✓ Pause on key information (3-5 seconds)
✓ Every AI decision must be explained in plain English
