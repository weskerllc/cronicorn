**Audience**: Developers, DevOps Engineers, SaaS Builders  
**Duration**: 2:30 - 3:00 minutes  
**Placement**: Homepage hero, GitHub README

---

## 🎯 Core Message

**"Stop manually adjusting cron schedules. Let Cronicorn adapt automatically."**

Cronicorn is the only HTTP job scheduler with AI-powered adaptation that learns from your endpoints and optimizes timing in real-time—all while respecting your safety constraints.

---

## 📖 Story Arc (5 Acts)

### 1️⃣ **The Problem** (0:00 - 0:30)
- **Show**: Static cron jobs failing during API crisis
- **Pain**: Developer manually adjusting schedules at 2 AM
- **Hook**: "Traditional cron doesn't learn. Cronicorn does."

### 2️⃣ **The Setup** (0:30 - 1:15)
- **Show**: 5-minute onboarding flow
- **Actions**: Create job → Add endpoint → Set baseline + constraints
- **Key Point**: No code changes, just point at existing HTTP endpoints

### 3️⃣ **The Magic** (1:15 - 2:15) ⭐ **HERO SECTION**
- **Show**: Timeline visualization of AI adaptation
- **Sequence**:
  1. Baseline: Regular 5-minute intervals (all green)
  2. Crisis: 3 failures → AI tightens to 30 seconds (red → monitoring)
  3. Recovery: Success → AI gradually backs off → returns to baseline
- **Key Point**: Automatic, no manual intervention

### 4️⃣ **The Control** (2:15 - 2:45)
- **Show**: Full execution logs + AI decision explanations
- **Key Point**: Complete transparency—every decision explained in plain English

### 5️⃣ **The Close** (2:45 - 3:00)
- **Show**: Comparison (Traditional vs Cronicorn) + CTA
- **CTA**: "Sign up free at cronicorn.com"

## 🎨 Visual Highlights

### Must-Have Visuals
1. **Timeline Animation** - The star of the demo
   - Colored dots showing executions over time
   - Visual compression/expansion during adaptation
   - Annotations for different phases

2. **AI Hint Panel** - Transparency in action
   ```
   🤖 AI Active: Checking every 30s
   Reason: 3 consecutive failures detected
   Expires in: 45 minutes
   ```

3. **Constraints Callout** - Safety-first design
   ```
   Min: 30s ← prevents rate limiting
   Max: 15m ← ensures timely checks
   ```

4. **Comparison Split-Screen** - Before/After contrast

## 💬 Key Talking Points

### What Makes Cronicorn Unique?
1. **Only platform with AI-powered schedule adaptation**
2. **Zero code changes** - works with existing HTTP endpoints
3. **Safety-first** - min/max constraints prevent runaway behavior
4. **Complete transparency** - every AI decision explained
5. **Works without AI** - baseline scheduler is production-ready

### Developer Benefits
- ✅ 5-minute setup (not hours)
- ✅ No SDK to install or deploy
- ✅ Automatic backoff during failures
- ✅ Full execution logs for debugging
- ✅ Self-hosting available

### Business Value
- 💰 Reduce wasted API calls (respect rate limits)
- 🚨 Catch issues faster (adaptive monitoring)
- ⏰ Save developer time (no manual tuning)
- 📊 Clear audit trail (compliance-ready)

## 🎬 Production Quick Reference

### Recording
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 @ 30fps
- **Software**: OBS Studio, Loom, or ScreenFlow
- **Browser**: Clean profile, no extensions, 100-125% zoom
- **Segments**: Record in pieces, edit together (easier than one take)

### Voiceover
- **Tone**: Professional but friendly, not sales-y
- **Pacing**: Slow down for key concepts, speed up for navigation
- **Equipment**: USB microphone (Blue Yeti, Rode NT-USB)
- **Script**: See full plan for complete voiceover script

### Editing
- **Software**: Premiere Pro, Final Cut, or DaVinci Resolve
- **Transitions**: Subtle crossfades (0.5s), avoid flashy effects
- **Music**: Optional, very subtle background (-25 to -30 dB)
- **Text**: Large, readable at 720p, high contrast

### Export
- **Master**: MP4, H.264, 1080p, 10-15 Mbps
- **Web**: MP4, H.264, 1080p, 5-8 Mbps
- **Mobile**: MP4, H.264, 720p, 2-4 Mbps
- **Preview GIF**: 800x600, 15fps, 10 seconds (AI adaptation moment)

## ⏱️ Time Budget

| Phase | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| Pre-production | 1-2 hours |
| Screen recording | 2-3 hours |
| Voiceover | 1 hour |
| Video editing | 3-5 hours |
| Review & revisions | 1 hour |
| Export & upload | 0.5 hours |
| **Total** | **8-12 hours** |

## 🎯 Critical Success Factors

### What Makes This Demo Work?
1. **Show, don't tell** - Let the timeline visualization speak
2. **Real behavior** - Actual AI adaptation, not mockups
3. **Relatable pain** - Every developer has fought with cron
4. **Clear value** - Time saved, issues prevented, API costs reduced
5. **Easy start** - 5-minute setup, no commitment

### What to Avoid
- ❌ Too many features (focus on core value)
- ❌ Technical jargon without explanation
- ❌ Rushed pacing (let key moments breathe)
- ❌ Weak CTA (be specific: cronicorn.com)
- ❌ Long runtime (>3 min = drop-off)
