# Cronicorn Brand Voice & Messaging Guidelines

## 🎯 Brand Positioning Statement

**For** developers and operations teams **who** schedule HTTP calls and struggle with rigid, blind-to-context cron jobs, **Cronicorn** is a hosted scheduling service **that** reads response data, interprets natural language descriptions, and adapts execution frequency automatically **unlike** traditional cron jobs and static schedulers **which** ignore what endpoints return and treat every moment the same.

---

## 🗣️ Brand Voice Pillars

### 1. **Intelligent**
We're smart about scheduling, not just fast. Our decisions are informed by data, patterns, and context.

**Do:**
- Explain the reasoning behind AI decisions
- Use precise, technical language when appropriate
- Demonstrate understanding of complex systems
- Reference data and patterns

**Don't:**
- Oversimplify or dumb down concepts
- Use "AI magic" or hand-wavy explanations
- Make claims without backing them up
- Treat users like they don't understand technology

**Examples:**
✅ "Traffic surge detected—tightening monitoring to 30 seconds"
✅ "AI analyzes success rates, response times, and failure patterns"
❌ "Our AI magically knows what to do"
❌ "Smart technology that just works"

---

### 2. **Confident**
We know we solve a real problem well. We're not apologetic about our capabilities.

**Do:**
- Make direct, declarative statements
- Stand behind our differentiation
- Use active voice
- State benefits clearly

**Don't:**
- Hedge with "maybe" or "might"
- Overuse qualifiers like "potentially" or "could"
- Sound boastful or arrogant
- Compare negatively to competitors

**Examples:**
✅ "Never miss the perfect moment to run your code"
✅ "Cronicorn adapts to your reality"
❌ "Cronicorn might help you schedule better"
❌ "Other schedulers are terrible at this"

---

### 3. **Human**
We're engineers talking to engineers. We use clear language and relate to real pain points.

**Do:**
- Use conversational tone
- Reference real-world scenarios
- Acknowledge the struggles ("we've been there")
- Use humor sparingly and appropriately
- Employ second person ("you," "your")

**Don't:**
- Sound corporate or overly formal
- Use unnecessary jargon
- Write in third person about users
- Force jokes or try too hard to be funny

**Examples:**
✅ "Stop getting paged at 3 AM for issues that fix themselves"
✅ "Your team deserves to sleep through the night"
❌ "Organizations may experience operational inefficiencies"
❌ "It's cron-tastic! 🎉" (forced pun)

---

### 4. **Transparent**
We show our work. No black boxes, no hidden surprises.

**Do:**
- Explain how things work
- Show reasoning for decisions
- Admit limitations
- Provide clear documentation
- Surface data and metrics

**Don't:**
- Hide behind "proprietary algorithms"
- Gloss over complexity
- Make promises we can't keep
- Use marketing speak to avoid technical details

**Examples:**
✅ "Every AI adjustment includes a clear reason"
✅ "AI hints have TTL and automatically expire"
❌ "Our proprietary AI engine optimizes everything"
❌ "Trust us, it just works"

---

### 5. **Practical**
We focus on solving real problems, not showcasing technology for its own sake.

**Do:**
- Lead with benefits, not features
- Use concrete examples
- Show before/after scenarios
- Quantify impact when possible
- Focus on outcomes

**Don't:**
- Lead with technical architecture
- Overwhelm with feature lists
- Use buzzwords without context
- Talk about AI without showing value

**Examples:**
✅ "Reduce alert fatigue by 80%"
✅ "Detect issues 10x faster during incidents"
❌ "Built with cutting-edge machine learning algorithms"
❌ "Leverages advanced neural networks for optimization"

---

## 📝 Writing Style Guidelines

### Tone: Professional but Approachable

**Think:** Senior engineer explaining to a colleague  
**Not:** Professor lecturing students  
**Not:** Salesperson pitching  

### Length: Concise and Scannable

- **Headlines:** 6-10 words max
- **Paragraphs:** 2-3 sentences max
- **Sentences:** 15-25 words average
- **Bullet points:** Preferred over paragraphs for lists

### Structure: Clarity First

1. Start with the benefit or outcome
2. Explain how it works
3. Provide technical details if needed
4. End with clear next action

### Active vs. Passive Voice

**Prefer active:**
✅ "Cronicorn detects the issue and tightens monitoring"
❌ "The issue is detected and monitoring is tightened by Cronicorn"

**Exception:** When the actor is irrelevant or obvious
✅ "Jobs are scheduled based on real-time conditions"

---

## 💬 Messaging Framework

### Primary Message
**"HTTP jobs that understand their own responses — controlled by descriptions, not code"**

Use when: Headlines, taglines, elevator pitch

### Supporting Messages

**1. For Reducing Alert Fatigue:**
"Stop getting paged for issues that fix themselves"

**2. For Incident Response:**
"Detect problems earlier. Resolve them faster."

**3. For Automation:**

[Technical detail if needed]

Example: [Concrete scenario]
```

**Example:**
"Tighten monitoring during incidents, relax when things calm down.

Cronicorn analyzes success rates and response times to automatically adjust check frequencies. Set min/max boundaries and AI respects them.

## 🚫 What We Don't Say

### Avoid These Patterns

**1. Unsubstantiated Claims**
❌ "The world's best job scheduler"
❌ "10x better than competitors"
✅ "Reduce alert fatigue by 80%" (with data)

**2. Hype Without Substance**
❌ "Revolutionary AI technology"
❌ "Groundbreaking innovation"
✅ "AI that learns from execution patterns"

**3. Complexity for Complexity's Sake**
❌ "Leveraging advanced neural networks for optimization"
✅ "Analyzes patterns to adjust schedules automatically"

**4. False Simplicity**
❌ "Just plug it in and forget about it"
✅ "Set baselines once, AI handles adjustments"

**5. Overselling AI**
❌ "AI solves everything automatically"
❌ "Let our AI do all the work"
✅ "AI adapts schedules; you stay in control"

---

## 📞 Audience-Specific Variations

### For DevOps Engineers
**Tone:** Technical, peer-to-peer
**Focus:** Automation, reliability, reducing toil
**Language:** Use terms like "runbooks," "oncall," "SLOs"

**Example:**
"Describe what matters in plain English — 'tighten to 30s when error_rate_pct > 5%' — and the AI reads your response bodies and adapts. Set min/max clamps and let the governor handle cadence."

### For Engineering Managers
**Tone:** Strategic, outcome-focused
**Focus:** Team efficiency, cost reduction, reliability
**Language:** Use terms like "productivity," "operational costs," "MTTR"

**Example:**
"Replace hand-tuned schedules with natural language descriptions. Your team writes what matters, the AI handles frequency adjustments based on real response data."

### For CTOs/Technical Leaders
**Tone:** Strategic, architectural
**Focus:** Scalability, competitive advantage, risk reduction
**Language:** Use terms like "resilience," "operational excellence," "automation maturity"

**Example:**
"Scheduling that adapts from response data, coordinates across endpoints, and operates within hard constraints. No custom code, no rule engines — descriptions and guardrails."

---

## 🎤 Sample Copy Examples

### Homepage Hero (Good)
**Headline:** HTTP Jobs That Understand Their Own Responses
**Subhead:** Endpoints adapt, coordinate, and trigger each other — controlled by descriptions, not code.
**CTA:** Get Started

### Feature Description (Good)
**Adaptive Intervals**

Stop treating every moment the same. Cronicorn adjusts monitoring frequency based on system health—tight checks when it matters, relaxed intervals when things are calm.

Set min/max boundaries. AI respects them. You stay in control.

### Blog Post Opening (Good)
Getting paged at 3 AM for a transient database blip that resolved itself in 30 seconds is not why you became an engineer. Yet here we are, in 2025, still using scheduling tools that treat every moment identically—whether your service is humming along or actively on fire.

There's a better way.

### Email Subject Line (Good)
"Your monitoring doesn't need to run 24/7 at the same pace"

- [ ] Does this sound like an engineer talking to another engineer?
- [ ] Is the benefit clear in the first sentence?
- [ ] Have we avoided empty buzzwords?
- [ ] Is technical detail present but not overwhelming?
- [ ] Would we say this in person?
- [ ] Is every claim backed up or obviously true?
- [ ] Does it pass the "so what?" test? (Reader cares why?)
- [ ] Are we showing, not just telling?
- [ ] Is the next action clear?
- [ ] Would our target user forward this to a colleague?
