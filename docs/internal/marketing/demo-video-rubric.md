**Narration:**
> "Minute 13: things get critical. 6,000 visitors, page load at 4.5 seconds, success rate drops to 60%. Watch what happens. AI tightens monitoring to the minimum—20 seconds. It activates diagnostics that were paused. It triggers cache warmup. And when orders drop below 120 per minute? It pages oncall."

**On-screen highlights:**
- **Traffic Monitor**: "Interval: 20s (min constraint enforced)"
- **Slow Page Analyzer**: "Status: ACTIVATED (was paused)"
- **Cache Warmup**: "Triggered: One-shot recovery action"
- **Emergency Oncall**: "Paged oncall: Critical threshold"

**What to capture:**
- Show **AI Session #3** at **12:15**:
  - Tool call: `pause_until(null)` - unpausing Slow Page Analyzer
  - Tool call: `propose_next_time(5000, 5)` - cache warmup in 5 seconds
  - Reasoning: "CRITICAL: Page load times at 4600ms..."
- Show endpoint list with **4 tiers** visible:
  - Health (3): Continuous, tightened
  - Investigation (2): Now active (was paused)
  - Recovery (2): One-shot actions (purple dots)
  - Alert (4): Escalation (purple dots)
- Response body metrics at critical peak:
  ```json
  {
    "traffic": 6000,
    "pageLoadMs": 4500,
    "ordersPerMin": 120,
    "inventoryLagMs": 600,
    "dbQueryMs": 1200
  }
  ```

### SHOT 3D: Recovery & Hint Expiration (68-85 seconds)

**Visual:**
- Pan timeline to **Day 6, 12:21-12:39** (Recovery phase)
- Show colors shifting back: Orange → Blue → Green
- Show metrics improving in response bodies
- Jump to **Day 6, 13:05** - hint expiration moment

**Narration:**
> "Minute 21: recovery begins. Traffic drops, page load improves. AI confirms the recovery and loosens back to baseline. By 13:05—exactly 60 minutes later—all AI hints expire automatically. The system returns to normal. No manual intervention required."

**On-screen highlights:**
- **Minute 28** (12:28): "AI Session #4: Recovery confirmed"
- Show tool call: `propose_interval(60000, 30)` - back to 1 minute
- **Minute 65** (13:05): "AI Session #5: Hints expired"
- Show reasoning: "All AI hints expired (60-min TTL). Baseline schedules fully resumed."
- **Day 7, 08:00**: "AI Session #6: Stability confirmed"

**What to capture:**
- Show **AI Session #4** reasoning: "Recovery confirmed. Traffic declining to 1,400/min, page load improved to 1,050ms..."
- Show timeline return to green (baseline-interval source)
- Show **AI Session #5** with TTL expiration message
- Pan to Day 7 showing normal baseline pattern restored

**Metrics to show:**
- Recovery phase: traffic: 1500, pageLoadMs: 1100, ordersPerMin: 50
- Post-expiration: traffic: 1050, pageLoadMs: 820, ordersPerMin: 42

### SHOT 4: Key Differentiators (85-95 seconds)

**Visual:**
- Cut to **endpoint configuration view** showing:
  - **Traffic Monitor** endpoint details
  - Min interval: 20,000ms (20 seconds)
  - Max interval: 300,000ms (5 minutes)
  - Baseline interval: 60,000ms (1 minute)
- Show **AI Sessions** list panel with all 6 sessions visible
- Quick highlight of **source attribution** legend

**Narration:**
> "Three things make this different: One—every decision is transparent. You saw exactly why AI tightened to 30 seconds. Two—you control the boundaries. Min 20 seconds, max 5 minutes. AI operates within your constraints. Three—it works perfectly without AI. Baseline schedules continue if AI is unavailable."

**On-screen text:**
- "✓ Every decision explained"
- "✓ Min/max constraints enforced"
- "✓ Works without AI"

**What to capture:**
- Show **min/max constraint fields** in endpoint configuration
- Show **all 6 AI sessions** in list view with timestamps
- Show **baseline interval** field highlighted
- Optional: Show AI toggle or configuration (if exists in UI)

### RECORDING TIPS

**Screen Recording Settings:**
- Resolution: 1920x1080 (1080p minimum)
- Frame rate: 30fps (60fps if smooth panning is critical)
- Software: QuickTime (macOS), OBS Studio, or similar
- Cursor: Smooth, deliberate movements (not erratic)
- Hide unnecessary UI: Browser bookmarks bar, dock (if possible)

**Dashboard Prep:**
- Clear any notification badges or distractions
- Ensure browser is full-screen or zoomed appropriately
- Have all panels/views pre-navigated (practice run first)
- Consider multiple takes per shot (choose best later)

**Timing the Recording:**
- Seed data is relative to "NOW" so timing is consistent
- Flash sale always appears at Day 6, 12:00-13:00 (25 hours ago)
- Run seed script fresh before recording to ensure clean data

**Multiple Takes Strategy:**
- Record each SHOT separately (easier to edit)
- Record 2-3 takes of each shot
- Keep recording even if you make small mistakes (fix in post)
- Record timeline pans slowly (speed up in post if needed)

**Script Version:** 1.0
**Based on Seed Data:** `apps/migrator/src/seed.ts` (commit: [pending])
**Ready for:** Production recording
**Estimated Edit Time:** 3-5 hours (depending on polish level)
