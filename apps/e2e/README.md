# E2E Testing with Playwright

This workspace contains end-to-end tests for the Cronicorn project using Playwright.

## Quick Start

**Important:** E2E tests require all apps to be running first

From the **repository root** (recommended):

```bash
# Run all apps in dev mode
pnpm dev

# Run all E2E tests (headless) - builds packages first
pnpm test:e2e
```
