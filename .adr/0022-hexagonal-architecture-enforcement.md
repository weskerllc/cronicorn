# Hexagonal Architecture Enforcement in Services Layer

**Date:** 2025-10-17
**Status:** Accepted

## Context

During an architectural review, we identified violations of hexagonal architecture principles in the services layer:

1. **Services importing concrete adapters**: `SubscriptionsManager` directly imported and depended on `StripePaymentProvider` (a concrete adapter implementation) instead of the `PaymentProvider` port (interface).

2. **Package-level adapter dependencies**: The `@cronicorn/services` package declared dependencies on concrete adapter packages (`@cronicorn/adapter-stripe`, `@cronicorn/adapter-drizzle`, etc.) in its `package.json`.

3. **Worker dependencies in services**: The services package incorrectly depended on `@cronicorn/worker-scheduler`.

These violations broke the dependency inversion principle and prevented us from easily swapping implementations or testing with mocks.

## Decision

We enforced strict hexagonal architecture boundaries by:

### 1. Enhanced PaymentProvider Port

Added `extractTierFromSubscription(subscriptionData: unknown): "pro" | "enterprise" | null` method to the `PaymentProvider` port. This provides a provider-agnostic way to extract tier information from subscription webhook data.

**Rationale**: The need to map price IDs to tiers is a legitimate domain concept ("given subscription data, determine the tier"), not a Stripe-specific implementation detail. By adding it to the port, we allow any payment provider to implement its own tier extraction logic.

### 2. Removed Concrete Dependencies from Services

- Removed `StripePaymentProvider` import from `SubscriptionsManager`
- Updated constructor to only accept `SubscriptionDeps` (which contains the `PaymentProvider` port)
- Replaced `stripeProvider.getTierFromPriceId()` calls with `paymentProvider.extractTierFromSubscription()`

### 3. Cleaned Package Dependencies

Removed all adapter and worker dependencies from `packages/services/package.json`:
- ❌ `@cronicorn/adapter-cron`
- ❌ `@cronicorn/adapter-drizzle`
- ❌ `@cronicorn/adapter-system-clock`
- ❌ `@cronicorn/adapter-stripe`
- ❌ `@cronicorn/worker-scheduler`

Services now only depends on `@cronicorn/domain`.

### 4. Updated Composition Roots

Modified `createSubscriptionsManager()` factory to:
- Remove the `stripeProvider` parameter
- Wire dependencies exclusively through the `PaymentProvider` port

## Consequences

### Positive

- ✅ **True dependency inversion**: Services depend on abstractions (ports), not concrete implementations
- ✅ **Easier testing**: Can mock `PaymentProvider` without importing Stripe adapter
- ✅ **Clear boundaries**: Package dependencies enforce architectural rules at build time
- ✅ **Pluggable implementations**: Could swap Stripe for another provider without touching services layer
- ✅ **Better separation of concerns**: Domain logic separated from infrastructure

### Neutral

- 📝 **More port methods**: Adding provider-agnostic abstractions increases port surface area
- 📝 **Type safety trade-off**: `extractTierFromSubscription` accepts `unknown` and must validate at runtime

### Negative

- ⚠️ **Migration effort**: Existing code using deprecated `getTierFromPriceId` should be updated
- ⚠️ **Slightly more verbose**: Extracting tier requires passing full subscription object vs just price ID

## Implementation Notes

The `extractTierFromSubscription` implementation in `StripePaymentProvider` uses defensive type guards to safely navigate the `unknown` subscription data structure without type assertions.

```typescript
extractTierFromSubscription(subscriptionData: unknown): "pro" | "enterprise" | null {
  // Runtime validation of nested structure
  if (/* checks for items.data[0].price.id */) {
    return this.reversePriceMap.get(priceId) ?? null;
  }
  return null;
}
```

This approach maintains type safety while working with webhook data that arrives as `unknown`.
